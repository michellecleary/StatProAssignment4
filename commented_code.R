# The following code will first define functions to set up a simple neural 
# network for classification, and to train it using stochastic gradient descent. 
# It will then use a training subset of the iris dataset to train a network to 
# classify irises to species based on the 4 characteristics given. The 
# performance of the network will then be evaluated using the misclassification 
# rate (i.e. the proportion misclassified) for the test subset pf the iris 
# dataset.


#### Function definitions


# A simple, fully-connected L-layer neural network of 
netup <- function(d){
  # Function to create a list representing the neural network with d[l] nodes 
  # in layer l.
  #
  # Inputs:
  # d: vector giving the number of nodes in each layer of the network
  #
  # Outputs:
  # nn: network list containing the following elements:
  #     h: list of node values in each layer of the network
  #     W: list of corresponding weight matrices to link each layer to the next 
  #        one 
  #     b: list of offset vectors linking each layer to the next one
  
  # Initialise empty lists to store h, W, and b

# Each node value is determined by linearly combining the values from the nodes

# ReLU(z) = max(0, z). Therefore, we have that node j in layer l + 1 is given 
# by:
# h_j^(l + 1) = max(0, W_j^l h^l + b^l),
# where W_j^l is the jth row of weight parameter matrix W^l which links layer l 
# to layer l + 1, h^l is the vector of node values for layer l, and b^l is the
# vector of offset parameters which links layer l to layer l + 1.

# For a classification task in which numeric variables are used to predict which 
# class an observation belongs to, the input layer would have a node for each 
# numeric variable, and the output layer, layer L, would have a node for each
# possible class. Then, we define the probability that the output variable is 
# in class k to be:
# p_k = exp(h_k^L) / sum_{j} exp(h_j^L).
# Then, using the negative log-likelihood of a multinomial distribution as the 
# loss function, if we have n training data pairs with input, x_i, and output
# class, k_i, the loss is:
# L = -sum_{i = 1,..,n} log(p_{k_i}) / n.
# Stochastic gradient descent involves minimising L by repeatedly finding 
# the gradient of the loss function, L, with respect to the parameters, and
# adjusting the parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative 
# gradient. The following function will compute the gradient of the loss 
# function with respect to the nodes (h), weights (W), and offsets (b) for a 
# given output class. 
#
# The derivative of the loss for k_i with respect to the nodes in the final
# layer is given by:
# dL_i/dh_j^L = exp(h_j^L) / sum_{q} exp(h_q^L) - 1 when j = k_i, and
# dL_i/dh_j^L = exp(h_j^L) / sum_{q} exp(h_q^L) otherwise.
# The derivatives of L_i with respect to all the other h_j^l can be computed 
# using back-propagation as:
# dL_i/dh^l = (W^l)^T d^(l + 1), where d_j^(l + 1) = dL_i/dh_j^(l + 1) if
# h_j^(l + 1) > 0, and d_j^(l + 1) = 0 if h_j^(l + 1) <= 0.
# The derivatives of L_i with respect to the weights and the offsets are then
# given by:
# dL_i/dW^l = d^(l + 1) (h^l)^T; dL_i/db^l = d^(l + 1).

# The idea of stochastic gradient descent is to minimise the loss by 
# repeatedly finding the gradient of the loss function with respect to the 
# parameters for small randomly chosen subsets of the training data, and to 
# adjust the parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative 
# gradient. The gradient of L is just the average of the gradients of
# L_i = âˆ’log(p_{k_i}) for each element of the training data, so we can compute
# the gradient one data point at a time.
# For a single datum i in this small subset, consisting of input data 
# x_i with class k_i, this is done as follows:
# 1. Set h^1 = x_i and compute the remaining node values h_j^l corresponding to 
# this using the ReLU transform, as in forward().
# 2. Compute the derivative of the loss for k_i with respect to the nodes in the 
# final layer, h_j^L, as in backward().
# 3. Compute the derivatives of the loss with respect to all the other h_j^l
# using back-propagation, and the derivatives with respect to the weights and 
# the offsets, as in backward().
#
# Repeat these steps for each datum i in the subset of the training data, and
# compute the derivative of the loss based on this subset by averaging the 
# derivatives for each i in the set. The parameter updates are then of the form:
# W^l <- W^l - eta (dL/dW^l)
# b^l <- b^l - eta (dL/db^l)
# where eta is a step length.
